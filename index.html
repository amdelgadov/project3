    <p> For this project I will create a museum kind of presention on how I would like to design my house I will show how I want to have the outside of the house and then ill go through the house and show the rooms and then the the outside and the meaning it would have to me, to have a house like that. This project will be an inspo for what I have always dreamed of doing when I grow up, it is a way of what my work can be and how I can put my ideas and goals and make them real life where I can make it a living. I am excited for this project because I may have an idea of what I would like to do but it can also come out to look very differently then I had thought. So we'll see how it goes. </p>
